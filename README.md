A game of Biquadris consists of two boards, each 11 columns by 15 rows. Blocks consisting of four cells (tetrominoes) appear at the top of each board, and you must drop them onto their respective boards so as not to leave any gaps.
Once an entire row has been filled, it disappears, and the blocks above move down by one unit. There is no time limit on when a block is placed.
The game alternates between the two players, turns ending when the player drops a block onto the board.

There are 7 types of blocks:
IIII - block
